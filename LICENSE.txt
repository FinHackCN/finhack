 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
引言
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. GNU通用公共许可协议（为方便阅读，以下简称“GPL协议”）是一种适用于软件和其他各类作品的自由且不可加以限制的（copyleft）版权许可协议。

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

大多数软件和其他作品的许可协议是以排除分享和修改作品的权利为出发点进行设计的。与之相反，GPL协议意在保证分享、修改一项程序的各个版本的自由——以保证这个程序对所有用户都是自由软件。我们自由软件基金会在自己的大部分软件上使用了GPL协议，GPL协议同样也适用于任何其他由作者以此种方式发布的作品。你也可以将GPL协议适用于你的程序。

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

当我们在谈论free software（自由软件）的时候，这里的free是指自由，而不是免费。我们设计GPL协议即是为了确保你能够自由分发自由软件的副本（你可以为此收取费用）、收到源代码或者在需要的时候获取源代码、修改软件或者在新的自由程序中使用其中的片段，并保证你能够确信自己有权做上述的事情。

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

为了保护你的权利，我们需要避免他人拒绝承认你的权利或者要求你放弃自己的权利。因此，你在分发软件副本或者修改软件的时候，也应当负起尊重他人自由的责任。

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

例如，如果你分发此类程序的副本，无论是否收费，你必须给予收到副本的人与你同样的自由。你必须确保他人获得或者可以获得程序的源代码。同时你也必须向他们提供本协议的条款，使他们知晓自己的权利。

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

使用GPL协议的开发者通过两个步骤来保障你的权利：（1）申明软件版权；以及（2）向你提供本许可协议以授权你复制、分发和/或修改该软件的合法许可。

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

对于开发者和作者的保护，GPL协议明确说明了该自由软件不存在任何保证。同时为了用户和作者，GPL协议要求应对修改后的版本进行标注，以免错误地将修改版本的问题归咎于先前版本的作者。

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

尽管生产厂商可以在设备中安装或运行软件的修改版本，但是部分设备在设计上还是会拒绝用户在其中安装或运行修改版本软件的权限。这与我们保护用户修改软件自由的目标在根本上是矛盾的。这种不当的系统模式在个人产品中的出现恰恰是最无法接受的。因此，我们设计了这一版GPL协议来防止此类情况。如果此类问题还发生在其他领域，我们也为保护用户自由，做好了在将来的GPL条款中扩展这些领域的准备。

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

最后，所有程序都面临着软件专利的持续威胁。国家不应该允许专利限制通用计算机软件的开发和使用，但是，在存在此类限制的国家，我们希望避免适用于自由程序的专利可能导致该程序实际上变为专有的特殊危险。为防止此类情况的发生，GPL协议确保了专利无法使程序非自由化。

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. 以下是关于复制、分发以及修改的详细条款和条件。

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
条款和条件
0. Definitions.
0. 定义
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“本协议”是指GNU通用公共许可协议第3版。

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“版权”亦包括适用于其他种类作品的类版权法律，例如半导体光罩。

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

“程序”指根据本协议进行许可的任何受版权保护的作品。每个被许可人称为“你”。“被许可人”和“接收者”可以是个人或组织。

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

“修改（modify）”一个作品是指以需要版权许可的方式对作品的全部或部分进行复制（copy）或者改编（adapt），有别于制作一致的副本。所产生的作品称为前作的“修改版”或“基于”前作的作品。

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

“受保护的作品（covered work）”是指未经修改的程序或者基于程序而产生的作品（a work based on the Program）。

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

“传播”一个作品是指除在计算机上执行或者修改私有副本以外的，根据所适用的版权法律，只要未经许可实施就会使你承担直接或间接侵权责任的任何行为。传播包括复制、分发（无论修改与否）、向公众提供、以及在一些国家的其他行为。

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

“转发”一个作品是指任何一种可以使其他方制作或接收副本的传播行为。仅仅通过计算机网络与用户进行交互，而没有传输任何副本的行为不属于转发。

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

一个显示“适当的法律声明”的用户交互界面应具有下列方便且醒目的可见特征：（1）显示适当的版权声明，以及（2）告知用户该作品不存在任何保证（提供保证的除外）、被许可人可以根据本协议转发作品以及查阅本协议的途径。如果界面展示的是一系列命令或选项，例如菜单，在列表提供醒目的选项方能满足上述要求。

1. Source Code.
1. 源代码
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

作品的“源代码”是指对作品进行修改所首选的作品形式。“目标代码”是指作品的任何非源代码形式。

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

“标准接口”是指由受认可的标准组织定义的官方标准，或者在特定编程语言所指定的接口中为该语言的开发者所广泛使用的接口。

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

可执行作品的“系统库”包括任何（a）不属于主要组件（Major Component）的一部分，但却包含在主要组件封装的一般结构中，并且（b）仅为主要组件的工作提供必要支持或者为使公众获取源代码而实施标准接口提供必要支持的内容，而非该作品的整体。“主要组件”在此背景下是指运行可执行作品所依赖的特定操作系统（如有）的主要的、必不可少的组件（内核、窗口系统等），或用来产生作品的编译器，或运行作品所需的目标代码解释器。

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

目标代码形式的作品，其“相应的源代码”是指生成 、安装、（对可执行作品来说）运行目标代码以及修改作品所需的全部源代码，包括控制上述活动的脚本。但是，其中不包含系统库、通用工具或者在未经修改的情况下为实施上述活动而使用的一般可获得的且不属于作品的一部分的自由程序。例如，相应的源代码包括与作品的源文件相关联的接口定义文件，以及作品明确依赖的共享库和动态链接子程序的源代码，诸如子程序与作品的其他部分之间存在密切的数据交换或控制流的情形。

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

相应的源代码不需要包括用户可以通过相应的源代码的其它部分自动生成的内容。

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

作品相应的源代码如是源代码形式，其即等同于作品本身。

2. Basic Permissions.
2. 基本许可
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

根据本协议授予的所有权利的期限为程序的版权期限，此等授权在满足条件的情况下是不可撤销的。本协议明确确认你不受限制地运行未修改的程序的权利。仅在输出内容构成受保护的作品时，运行受保护的作品所产生的输出受本协议的约束。本协议承认你根据版权法律所享有的合理使用的权利以及其他等同的权利。

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

只要你的许可仍然有效，你就可以无条件地制作、运行和传播你未转发的受保护的作品。你可以将受保护的作品转发给他人，该等转发仅限于他人专门为你进行修改或者为你提供运行该作品的设备的目的，并且此等转发应以你在转发一切版权不由你所控制的材料时遵守本协议的条款为前提。因此，为你制作或运行受保护的作品的人必须在您的指导和控制下，且只能以你的名义，并在禁止他们在除你和他们之间的关系之外复制你的受版权保护的材料的条件下来制作或运行受保护的作品。

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

其他情形下的转发仅仅在符合下述的条件时才能被允许。禁止转授权；转授权因第10条的规定并不必要。

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights from Anti-Circumvention Law.
3. 针对反规避技术措施法律的用户权利保护
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

受保护的作品不应被视为任何，履行12月20日通过的《WIPO版权条约》第11条所规定义务的准据法（所适用的法律）或者其他禁止或限制规避技术措施的相似法律下，有效的技术措施的一部分。

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

当你转发受保护的作品时，你同意放弃任何禁止为行使本协议下与受保护的作品相关的权利而实施的规避技术措施行为的权利，并且你同意放弃以执行你和第三方所具有的禁止规避技术措施行为的法律权利为手段的任何限制用户对作品进行操作或修改的意图。

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
4. 转发未修改的副本
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

你可以在收到程序源代码后通过任何形式转发未经修改的程序源代码的副本，但你须在每份副本中显著而恰当地发布适当的版权声明；保留陈述本协议和根据本协议第7条适用于代码的任何非许可性条款的内容的完整声明。

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

你可以免费转发副本或者对转发的副本收取费用，也可以提供支持或保修以收取费用。

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
5. 转发修改后的源代码版本
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

你可以以第4条规定的源代码的形式，转发基于本程序的作品或其修改内容，但必须同时满足下列条件：

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

a) 该作品须具有显著的声明，说明您对该作品进行了修改并提供修改相关的日期。

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

b) 该作品须具有显著的声明，说明该作品是依据本协议以及根据第7条附加的条件进行发布的。本要求将把第4条所列的对应要求修改为“保留”完整保留所有声明。

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

c) 你必须根据本协议将作品整体完整地许可给任何拥有其副本的人。本协议及其适用的任何根据本协议第7条附加的条款适用于整个作品和作品的所有部分，无论其如何封包。本协议不允许以任何其他方式许可该作品，但如果你单独接受了其他方式的许可，本协议并不当然导致该等许可无效。

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

d) 如果该作品具有交互式用户界面，则每个用户界面均须显示适当的法律声明；但如果本程序具有交互式用户界面却不显示适当的法律声明，你的作品也无需进行显示。

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

存储在存储空间或分发介质上的受保护的作品与其他独立的作品的汇编，同时其在性质上不是受保护的作品的扩展，并且没有与之相结合而构成更大的程序，如果该汇编及其产生的版权没有被用来超越其中的单体作品的许可对该汇编的用户的访问和法律权利进行限制，则称之为“聚合”。在聚合中包含受保护的作品并不会使本协议适用于该聚合的其他部分。

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
6. 以非源代码形式转发
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

你可以根据本协议第4条和第5条的规定转发目标代码形式的受保护的作品，但你必须同时根据本协议转发及其可读的相应的源码，此等转发需符合下列方式之一：

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

a) 转发收录在实体产品（包括实体的分发媒介）中的目标代码，并附带固定在常用于软件交换的耐用型物理介质上的相应的源码。

b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

b) 转发收录在实体产品（包括实体的分发媒介）中的目标代码，并附带一份书面要约，该书面要约应给予任何持有该目标代码的主体(1)以不高于你实际进行源码转发的合理成本的价格，一份产品中所有受本协议约束的软件的相应的源码的副本，此副本应储存与常用于软件交换的耐用型物理介质之上，或者(2)对相应的源码的免费的网络服务器访问；此要约在你提为该产品型号提供备件或客户支持期间持续有效且有效期至少为三年。

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

c) 转发单独的目标代码的副本并附带一份提供相应的源码的书面要约副本。此选项仅能在偶尔性的且非商业性的情况下才能被允许，并且目标代码所附的要约应符合第6b条的要求。

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

d) 通过从指定的地点提供访问（免费或付费）来转发目标代码，并以相同的方式从同一地点提供对相应的源码提供同等的访问，提供对应的源码不得收取额外费用。你无需要求接收者同时复制目标代码和相应的源码。如果复制目标代码的地点是网络服务器，在你于目标代码旁设置清晰指引并说明在哪里可以或许相应的源码的前提下，你可以将相应的源码储存在另一台支持同样的复制功能呢的服务器上(该服务器由你而非第三方运营)。无论在任何服务器托管相应的源码，你都有义务保证它在为满足这些要求所需的期间内是可用的。

e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

e) 使用点对点（p2p）传输转发目标代码，但你必须根据第6d条将你在何处向一般公众免费提供作品的目标代码和相应的源码的信息通知给其他节点。

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

目标代码的可分割部分，即其源代码作为系统库被排除于相应的源码的部分，在转发时需包含在目标代码作品之中。

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“用户产品”是指(1) “消费产品”，即任何通常用于个人、家庭或者生活目的有形个人财产，或者(2)任何为在住宅中使用而设计或销售的物品。在判断一款产品是否属于消费产品时，存疑的情形应按照扩大消费产品覆盖范围的倾向进行决定。对于特定用户收到的特定产品，“通常用于”是指对该类产品典型的或常见的使用，不论该特定用户的状态或其实际使用、预期使用或被要求使用该产品的方式是怎样的。无论产品是否具有实质上的商业、工业或者非消费者用途，这些用途均不影响对消费产品的判断，除非前述用途代表了该产品唯一且重要的使用方式。

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

用户产品的“安装信息”是指任何方法、流程、授权密钥或其他在该用户产品中通过相应的源码的修改版安装和执行修改版受保护的作品的信息。该信息必须足以确保修改后的目标代码能够在持续工作中不会单纯因修改而被阻止或干扰。

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

如果你根据本条转发在用户产品中的、随同用户产品的或者专门用于用户产品的目标代码作品，并且该转发作为交易的一部分会使用户产品的占有权和使用权在在一定期限内或永久转让给接收者（无论该交易是如何描述的），根据本条所转发的相应的源码必须具有安装信息。但是，此要求在你或任何第三方都不具有在用户产品上安装修改版的目标代码的能力的情况下并不适用（例如作品被安装在ROM上的情况）。

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

提供安装信息这一要求中并不包括继续为接收者已修改或安装的作品或用户产品提供支持服务、保修或者更新的要求。当所做的修改本身对网络运行造成实质且负面的影响或者违反了网络通信协议和规则时，可以拒绝其网络访问。

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

根据本条所转发的相应的源码以及所提供的安装信息必须采用有公开记录的格式（并伴有公众可以取得的源代码形式的工具），且不得对解压、读取或复制设置密码或密钥。

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“用户产品（User Product）”是指(1) “消费产品”，即任何通常用于个人、家庭或者生活目的有形个人财产，或者(2)任何为在住宅中使用而设计或销售的物品。在判断一款产品是否属于消费产品时，存疑的情形应按照扩大消费产品覆盖范围的倾向进行决定。对于特定用户收到的特定产品，“通常用于”是指对该类产品典型的或常见的使用，不论该特定用户的状态或其实际使用、预期使用或被要求使用该产品的方式是怎样的。无论产品是否具有实质上的商业、工业或者非消费者用途，这些用途均不影响对消费产品的判断，除非前述用途代表了该产品唯一且重要的使用方式。

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

用户产品的“安装信息（Installation Information）”是指任何方法、流程、授权密钥或其他在该用户产品中通过相应的源码的修改版安装和执行修改版受保护的作品的信息。该信息必须足以确保修改后的目标代码能够在持续工作中不会单纯因修改而被阻止或干扰。

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

如果你根据本条转发在用户产品中的、随同用户产品的或者专门用于用户产品的目标代码作品，并且该转发作为交易的一部分会使用户产品的占有权和使用权在在一定期限内或永久转让给接收者（无论该交易是如何描述的），根据本条所转发的相应的源码必须具有安装信息。但是，此要求在你或任何第三方都不具有在用户产品上安装修改版的目标代码的能力的情况下并不适用（例如作品被安装在ROM上的情况）。

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

提供安装信息这一要求中并不包括继续为接收者已修改或安装的作品或用户产品提供支持服务、保修或者更新的要求。当所做的修改本身对网络运行造成实质且负面的影响或者违反了网络通信协议和规则时，可以拒绝其网络访问。

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

根据本条所转发的相应的源码以及所提供的安装信息必须采用有公开记录的格式（并伴有公众可以取得的源代码形式的工具），且不得对解压、读取或复制设置密码或密钥。

7. Additional Terms.
7. 附加条款
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

“附加许可（additional permissions）”是指对本协议的一个或多个条件设置例外的补充性条款。适用于整个程序的附加条款，在根据本协议有效的情况下应当被视为本协议的一部分。如果附加许可仅适用于部分程序，则该部分可单独在这些许可下使用，但整个程序仍受本协议的约束，而不考虑附加许可。

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

在你传播受保护的作品副本时，你可以选择从副本或其部分中移除任何附加许可。（附加许可可以要求你在特定情况下将其移除）对于你添加至受保护的作品的材料，如果你拥有这些材料或有权授予这些材料版权许可，你则可以对这些材料增添附加许可。

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

即使本协议其他任何条款另有规定，你可以（如果经该材料著作权人授权）对本协议条款进行以下补充：

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

a) 放弃保证或者以不同于第15、16条的方式限制责任；或者

b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

b) 要求在该材料或者在包含材料的作品所展示的适当的法律声明中保留合理的特定法律声明或者作者署名；或者

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

c) 禁止对该材料来源的不当陈述，或者要求该材料修改后的版本对其与不同于原版做出合理的标注；或者

d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

d) 限制以宣传为目的使用该材料授权者或作者的名称；或者

e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

e) 拒绝授予根据商标法授予商号、商标或者服务表示的权利；或者

f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

f) 在按照合同约定接收者负有责任的情况下，要求任何转发该材料（或者其修改版）的人向授权者和作者向进行赔偿，以免这些合同规定直接对授权者和作者施以任何责任。

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

其他所有非许可性附加条款，均属于第10条所规定的“其他限制”。在你收到程序或部分程序的声明中，如果除了说明程序受本协议约束外还含有其他限制，你则可以移除该等条款。如果一份许可文件中含有其他限制但却允许再许可或根据本协议进行转发的，你可以向受保护的作品中添加受此许可文件条款约束的其他材料，但应当在再许可或转发时移除其他限制。

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

若你根据本条在受保护的作品中加入了条款，你必须在附加条款适用的相关源文件中加入对附加条款的说明或者指明在何处找到所适用条款的通知。

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

不论是许可性还是非许可性，附加条款可以以单独的书面许可形式发布或者以例外情形进行说明；任何方式均应符合上述的要求。

8. Termination.
8. 终止
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

除非明确经本协议允许，不得传播或修改受保护的作品。否则任何传播或修改受保护的作品的尝试均不合法，并将自动终止你在本协议下权利（包括任何根据第11条第3段授予的专利许可）。

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

但是，如果你停止一切违反本协议的行为，你从特定著作权人处获得的许可 (a) 将会临时恢复，除非并直到著作权人最终明确终止你的许可，和(b) 在著作权人在你停止违反协议后的60日内未通过合理方式通知你的违反协议的情况下，将会永久恢复。

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

此外，你从特定著作权人处获得的许可在著作权人通过合理方式通知你违反协议的情况，即你从著作权人处首次收到违反本协议的通知（对任意作品），你应当在收到通知后的30天内纠正违反协议的行为。

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

根据本条终止协议并不会终止根据本协议从你处收到副本或授权的当事人之间的许可协议。如果你的权利已被终止且没有永久恢复，你则失去根据第10条接收同样材料的新的许可的资格。

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
9. 持有副本无需接受协议
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

你无需接受本协议即可接收或运行程序的副本。仅在由于在使用点对点传输来接收副本时而发生的对受保护的作品的辅助传播情况下，亦无需对本协议进行接受。但是，只有本协议才能授予你传播或修改任何受保护的作品的权利。你在不接受本协议的情况下传播或修改任何受保护的作品的行为，将构成著作权侵权。因此，若你修改或传播受保护的作品，则表示你同意接受本协议的约束。

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
10. 对下游接收者的自动授权
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

当你转发受保护的作品时，接收者会根据本协议从原始授权者处自动获得运行、修改和传播该作品的许可。你不需要对第三方就本协议的合规负责。

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

“实体交易（entity transaction）”是指转让一个组织的控制权或者大体上的全部资产，亦或是组织的分立合并。如果受保护的作品因实体交易传播，该实体交易中收到作品副本的当事方也会获得在前利益相关者（predecessor in interest）所具有的或者能够根据前一段的内容所给予的对该作品的许可，另外，如果在前利益相关者持有或通过合理的努力能够获得作品相应的源码，该实体交易中收到作品副本的当事方则拥有从在前利益相关者处获得作品相应的源码的权利。

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

你不得对根据本协议所授予或肯定的权利的实行施以任何进一步限制。例如，你不得因他人行使本许可下授予的权利而收取许可费、版税或其他费用，并且不得以制造、使用、销售、许诺销售或者进口程序或程序的任何部分侵犯专利权利要求为由提起诉讼（包括在诉讼中提起交叉诉讼或反诉）。

11. Patents.
11. 专利
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”. A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

“贡献者（contributor）”是指根据本协议对程序或者程序所依赖的作品进行使用授权的著作权人。因此，这样的授权作品被称为贡献者的“贡献者版本（contributor version）”。贡献者的“基本专利权利要求”是指贡献者所有或控制的，可能会被本协议所允许的制造、使用或销售其贡献者版本的行为以某种方式所侵犯，的全部专利权利要求，无论是已经取得的还是即将获得的，但不包括仅因对贡献者版本的进一步修改而受到侵犯的权利要求。在本定义中，“控制（control）”包括拥有以符合本协议要求的方式对专利进行转授权的权利。

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

每个贡献者根据贡献者的基本专利权利要求授予您一个非排他性的、全球范围内的、免专利费的专利许可，用于制作、使用、销售、许诺销售、进口和以其他方式运行、修改和传播其贡献者版本的内容。

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

在以下三段中，“专利许可（patent license）”是指任何表示不会执行专利的明示协议或承诺，无论其如何命名（例如实施专利的明示许可或者不得就专利侵权提起诉讼的协议）。向一方“授予（grant）”此种专利许可是指作出不会对该方执行专利的协议或承诺。

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

如果你明知其依赖于某专利而转发受保护的作品，且未根据本协议通过公众可访问的网络服务器或者其他易于访问的方式免费为他人提供复制该作品相应的源码的途径，则你必须(1)使相应的源码可以被他人获取，或者(2) 放弃该作品的专利许可所带来的权益，或者(3)以符合本协议要求的方式，将专利许可扩展到下游接收者。“明知其依赖于”是指你实际知晓，若无专利许可，你在一个国家转发受保护的作品或者你的接收者在这个国家使用受保护的作品，将会侵犯你有理由相信有效的一项或多项可识别的该国专利。

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

如果根据一项交易或安排，或在与之相关的情况下，你转发或通过促成转发传播受保护的作品，并向收到受保护的作品的某些当事人授予专利许可，授权他们使用、传播、修改或转发受保护作品的特定副本，则你授予的专利许可会自动拓展至受保护作品以及基于它的作品的所有接收者。

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

如果专利许可 不包含在一项专利性许可所覆盖的范围内，禁止行使本许可明确授予的一项或多项权利或以不行使这些权利为条件，则属于“歧视性（discriminatory）”专利许可。如果你与从事软件分发业务的第三方签约并依约定根据作品转发活动的范围向第三方付费，在下列情况下你不得转发受保护的作品：(a)该第三方向任何从你处收到副本的一方授予与你转发的受保护的作品副本（或这些副本的复制件）相关的歧视性专利许可，或(b)该第三方向任何从你处收到副本的一方授予主要用于包含受保护的作品的特定产品或汇编或者与之相关的歧视性专利许可，除非你加入约定的时间或专利许可的时间在2007年3月28日之前。

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

本协议中的任何内容均不应被解释为排除或限制任何默示许可或其他在所适用的专利法下可能有效的侵权抗辩。

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
12. 不得弃置他人的自由
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

如果对你施加的条件（无论是通过法院命令、协议或其他方式）与本协议规定的条件相矛盾，其并不会免除你遵守本协议所设条件的义务。如果你在转发受保护的作品时无法同时满足本协议所设义务和其他相关义务，你则不得进行转发。例如，如果你同意了你有义务就向程序的转发对象就转发收取版税的条款，唯一能同时满足该义务和本协议规定的做法即为完全避免对本程序的转发。

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
13. 与GNU Affero通用公共许可协议的兼容
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

不论本协议其他条款如何规定，你可以将受保护的作品与任何根据GNU Affero通用公共许可协议进行授权的作品进行连接或结合，形成结合作品（combined work），并转发产生的作品。本协议条款将会继续适用于结合作品中属于受保护的作品的部分，但是GNU Affero通用公共许可协议第13条提出的关于通过网络交互的特殊要求将会适用于结合作品本身。

14. Revised Versions of this License.
14. 本许可协议的修订版
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

自由软件基金会可以不时地发布修改版或新版的GNU通用公共许可协议。新版本将秉持与早先版本同样的精神，但可能会为解决新的问题或担忧而在细节上有所不同。

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

每个版本都具会有不同的版本号。如果程序明确指出适用特定版本的GNU通用公共许可协议“或任何后续版本”，你可以选择采用自由软件基金会发布的该特定版本或者任何后续的版本的条款与条件。如果本程序并未明确指出其适用的GNU通用公共许可协议的版本号，你则可以选择自由软件基金会发布的任意一版。

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

如果本程序指定某一代理决定适用某一将来版本的GNU通用公共许可协议，则该代理接受某一版本的公共陈述将会永久授权你为程序选择该版本的的GNU通用公共许可协议协议。

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

新版本的许可协议可能会给予你额外的或不同的许可。但是，选择采用新版本的许可协议将不会向任何作者或者著作权人施加任何额外义务。

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
15. 免责声明
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

在所适用的法律允许的范围内，本程序不存在任何的保证。除非另有书面声明，著作权人和/或其他当事人“现以”不做出任何种类的、明示或默示的保证的方式提供本程序，包括但不限于对可销售性和适用于特定目的的默示保证。本程序质量与性能的一切风险均应由你自行承担。如果程序被证明有缺陷，您应承担所有必要的维护、修理或修正费用。

16. Limitation of Liability.
16. 责任限制
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

在任何情况下，除非所适用的法律要求或经书面同意，否则任何著作权人或任何根据上述条款修改和/或转发程序的其他当事人均不对你承担损害赔偿责任，包括任何因使用或无法使用本程序而产生的一般的、特殊的、附带或间接损害赔偿（包括但不限于数据丢失、数据篡改、你或第三方遭受的损失或者程序无法与其他任何程序共同运行），即使该著作权人或其他当事人已被告知此类损害的可能性。

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
17. 第15、16条的解释
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

如果前述免责声明和责任限制的条款无法获得当地法律效力，审查的法院应当适用最接近于放弃有关本程序的民事责任的本地法律规定，除非程序副本为其附带的保证或者责任承诺收费。

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
如何将上述条款适用于你的新程序中
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

如果你开发了一个新程序，并希望它尽最大限度为公众所使用，最好的办法就是使你的程序成为任何人可以根据本协议再分发和修改的自由软件。

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

为此，可以在程序中附上以下声明。将声明附在每个源文件的开头以有效做出免责说明是最保险的做法；并且每个文件应该有一行版权声明行，并指向可以找到完整声明的页面。

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

如果程序会进行终端交互，当程序在交互模式下启动时，让程序输出如下简短声明：
Copyright (C)

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

```

The hypothetical commands show w' andshow c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

上面的声明假定 “ show w”和“ show c” 命令会显GPL协议的相应部分。 当然，你的程序中的命令可以是不同的；在GUI界面中，你可以使用“关于”选项。

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

如有必要，你还应当让你的雇主（如果你是受雇的程序员）或学校，如有，签署一份“放弃版权声明”。关于这一点的更多详情，以及如何使用和遵守GNU GPL协议，请参考http://www.gnu.org/licenses/。

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html.

本GNU通用公共许可协议不允许将你的程序并入专有程序的行为。 如果你的程序是一个子程序库，更好的考虑是允许专有应用程序与该库进行链接，如果你确实希望允许此种情况，可以使用GNU Lesser General Public License（GNU较宽松通用公共许可协议，LGPL）而非本协议。但还请事先查阅http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html。
